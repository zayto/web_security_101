|[Security by obscurity](https://utkusen.com/blog/security-by-obscurity-is-underrated.html)|Avoid using default ports to run your apps so if they get scanned, they are less likely to be discovered. Also, obfuscate source code, minify JS code|\[0-65535\] is the port range, ssh port 22, *Risk = Likelihood x Impact*|

|[Nmap legal issues](https://nmap.org/book/legal-issues.html)|Reminder on what Nmap can do and how it's supposed to be used with the aggreement of the targeted domain. The law where the server is located applies and each country has its own legislation (on what is allowed and what can get you in trouble).|"Remember that many states have their own computer abuse laws, some of which can arguably make even pinging a remote machine without authorization illegal"|
|[Hakluke's guide to Nmap](https://medium.com/@hakluke/haklukes-guide-to-nmap-port-scanning-is-just-the-beginning-25d971692fdb)|Great guide on some basic usage of Nmap (port scanning and more)| - A bunch of commands - |

|[We didn't encrypt your password, we hashed it](https://www.troyhunt.com/we-didnt-encrypt-your-password-we-hashed-it-heres-what-that-means/)|Difference between hashing and encryption - Why salted hashes are mandatory - Why leaking hash is still an issue (bad passwords can be cracked)|Password hash for non-IT people: "A password hash is a representation of your password that can't be reversed, but the original password may still be determined if someone hashes it again and gets the same result."|
|[Understanding HSTS and preload](https://www.troyhunt.com/understanding-http-strict-transport/)|Strict-Transport-Security response header with max-age - HSTS is used to ensure any page in the domain is forced to be served via HTTPS for max-age duration - Preload option to ensure first connection is not made via HTTP by default (with a redirect to HTTPS) but directly through HTTPS (can't be bypassed because it's embedded in browsers)|HSTS with preload creates 307 Internal redirect - |
|[Abusing the Docker API](https://www.hackingarticles.in/docker-for-pentester-abusing-docker-api/)|Explains how Docker API can be exposed on a machine running Docker - you can remotely execute docker commands (by connecting with your docker demon) - you can connect to docker containers (possible container highjacking/container escape attack)|Docker API is a thing - Port 2375/tcp used|
